= Visual C++ Express wxWidgets library =

In order to make the svn repository more lightweight we have removed the pre-compiled wxWidgets libraries for Visual C++ Express. They can instead be downloaded from IT's learning. You can unzip them in the VC++ directory and continue as usual. If you need to put them somewhere else for storage reasons, you need to modify the paths to the headers and libraries in the project settings in Visual C++.
